# Boiler - Video Transcoding Tool

A simplified command-line tool for transcoding video files with automatic quality optimization. Boiler automatically finds the optimal encoding settings to achieve target bitrates while maintaining quality.

## Features

- 🎯 **Automatic bitrate targeting** - Sets target bitrates based on video resolution
- 🔍 **Quality optimization** - Iteratively finds optimal bitrate settings to hit target bitrates
- 🚀 **Hardware acceleration** - Uses Apple VideoToolbox for fast encoding on macOS
- 📊 **Progress feedback** - Color-coded output with clear status messages
- ⚡ **Fast iteration** - Uses multi-point sampling (3 samples per iteration) to quickly find optimal settings

## Current Defaults

- **Codec**: HEVC (H.265) via `hevc_videotoolbox` (Apple VideoToolbox hardware acceleration)
- **Container**: MP4
- **Quality control**: Bitrate mode (VideoToolbox doesn't support CRF)
- **Audio**: Copy (no re-encoding)
- **Target Bitrates**:
  - 2160p (4K): 11 Mbps
  - 1080p (Full HD): 8 Mbps
- **Platform**: Optimized for macOS Sequoia

## Requirements

- **macOS** - This tool is currently macOS-only (optimized for macOS Sequoia)
- **ffmpeg** - Video encoding/transcoding
- **ffprobe** - Video analysis (usually included with ffmpeg)
- **bc** - Calculator for bitrate computations

### Installing Dependencies

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

Note: `bc` is typically pre-installed on macOS. If not available, install with:
```bash
brew install bc
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Navigate to the directory containing your video file:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/video/directory
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./boiler.sh
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Find the video file in the current directory
   - Analyze its resolution and duration
   - Determine the target bitrate
   - Iteratively find the optimal bitrate setting by sampling from multiple points
   - Transcode the full video
   - Output: `{original_name}_transcoded.mp4`

### Example Output

```
[INFO] Found video file: my_video.mp4
[INFO] Video resolution: 2160p
[INFO] Target bitrate: 11 Mbps (2160p)
[INFO] Starting quality adjustment process...
[INFO] Sampling from 3 points (beginning, middle, end) to find optimal bitrate setting
[INFO] Iteration 1: Testing with bitrate=11.00 Mbps (11000 kbps)
[INFO] Average bitrate from 3 samples: 12.5 Mbps
[INFO] Actual bitrate too high, decreasing bitrate setting from 11000k to 9900k
[INFO] Iteration 2: Testing with bitrate=9.90 Mbps (9900 kbps)
[INFO] Average bitrate from 3 samples: 10.8 Mbps
[INFO] Bitrate is within acceptable range (10% of target)
[INFO] Optimal bitrate setting found: 9900 kbps (9.90 Mbps)
[INFO] Starting full video transcoding...
[INFO] Transcoding complete!
[INFO] Output file: my_video_transcoded.mp4
```

## How It Works

The script follows a modular architecture with focused functions for each step:

1. **Discovery**: Finds the first video file in the current directory
2. **Analysis**: Uses `ffprobe` to determine video resolution and duration
3. **Targeting**: Sets target bitrate based on resolution
4. **Optimization**: 
   - Samples from 3 points (beginning ~10%, middle ~50%, end ~90%)
   - Transcodes 15-second samples at different bitrate settings
   - Averages bitrates from all 3 samples
   - Adjusts bitrate setting until actual output matches target (±10% tolerance)
   - Maximum 10 iterations, exits with error if not converged
5. **Encoding**: Transcodes the full video using the optimal bitrate setting

The script is organized into modular functions for maintainability and clarity. All values are sanitized to prevent calculation errors, and logging output is properly separated from function return values.

## Supported Video Formats

The tool automatically detects these video file extensions:
- MP4 (`.mp4`)
- MKV (`.mkv`)
- AVI (`.avi`)
- MOV (`.mov`)
- M4V (`.m4v`)
- WebM (`.webm`)
- FLV (`.flv`)
- WMV (`.wmv`)

## Limitations

- **macOS-only** - Currently only supports macOS (VideoToolbox hardware acceleration requires macOS)
- Currently processes one video file per execution
- Must be run from the directory containing the video file
- Uses hardcoded defaults (not yet configurable)
- Audio is always copied (not re-encoded)
- VideoToolbox only supports bitrate mode, not CRF (quality-based encoding)

## Future Features

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the complete roadmap. Upcoming features include:

- 📁 **Batch processing** - Process multiple files at once
- 🎛️ **Command-line options** - Override defaults per-transcode
- 📊 **Enhanced output modes** - Progress indicators, verbose/quiet modes, dry-run
- ⚙️ **Configuration system** - Customize default bitrates, codecs, and containers
- 📦 **Installation** - Install as a system command, run from any directory
- 🌐 **Cross-platform support** - Port to Linux/Windows (currently macOS-only)

## Troubleshooting

### "ffmpeg is not installed or not in PATH"
Install ffmpeg using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### "No video file found in current directory"
Make sure you're in the directory containing the video file, or that the video file has a supported extension.

### "Could not determine video resolution"
The video file may be corrupted or in an unsupported format. Try checking the file with `ffprobe` directly:
```bash
ffprobe your_video.mp4
```

### Transcoding takes a long time
This is normal for high-resolution videos. The script uses hardware acceleration via VideoToolbox, which is significantly faster than software encoding. The optimization phase samples from multiple points, which may take a few minutes, but ensures accurate bitrate targeting.

### "Reached maximum iterations" error
If the script fails to converge within 10 iterations, it may indicate that the target bitrate is not achievable with the current settings, or there's an issue with the video file. Check that the video file is valid and not corrupted.

### Parse errors or calculation issues
The script includes value sanitization to prevent calculation errors. If you encounter parse errors, ensure that `bc` is properly installed and that video file metadata is readable. The script automatically cleans values before calculations to handle edge cases.

### Helper Scripts

For testing and development, helper scripts are available:

- **`./copy-1080p-test.sh`** - Copies the 1080p test video to the current directory
- **`./copy-4k-test.sh`** - Copies the 4K test video to the current directory  
- **`./cleanup-mp4.sh`** - Removes all .mp4 files from the project root directory

## Code Structure

The script is organized into modular functions for better maintainability:

- **Utility functions**: Video discovery, resolution/duration detection, requirement checking
- **Configuration functions**: Target bitrate calculation, sample point calculation
- **Transcoding functions**: Sample transcoding, bitrate measurement, optimization loop, full video transcoding
- **Main orchestration**: The `main()` function coordinates all steps

This modular structure makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain. For detailed technical information, see [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md).
